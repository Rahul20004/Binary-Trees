        // Recursively check left and right subtrees

Explaination: 

🌳 What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
In a valid BST, the following rules must be true for every node:

All nodes in the left subtree must have values less than the current node’s value.

All nodes in the right subtree must have values greater than the current node’s value.

Both left and right subtrees must also be valid BSTs.

🧠 Intuition Behind the Algorithm
We use a helper function to keep track of a valid range for each node.

Initially, the root node is allowed to have any value, so the range is (-∞ to +∞).

When we go to the left child, we update the max limit to be the current node’s value.

When we go to the right child, we update the min limit to be the current node’s value.

If any node’s value falls outside the allowed range, it's not a BST.

✅ Step-by-step Example
Valid BST Example:
markdown
Copy code
      10
     /  \
    5   15
       /  \
      11  20
Here's how we validate it:

Start at root 10: valid range (-∞, ∞)

Go left to 5: range (-∞, 10) ✅

Go right to 15: range (10, ∞) ✅

15's left child 11: range (10, 15) ✅

15's right child 20: range (15, ∞) ✅

👉 All nodes are within valid ranges — so this is a valid BST.

❌ Invalid BST Example:
markdown
Copy code
      5
     / \
    1   4
       / \
      3   6
This looks okay at first, but:

4 is on the right of 5 → should be greater than 5

But 4 is less than 5 → ❌ This breaks the rule.

So this is not a valid BST.

✅ Java Code (with Explanation)
java
Copy code
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public boolean isValidBST(TreeNode root) {
        return validate(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);
    }

    // Recursive function to validate the BST
    private boolean validate(TreeNode node, long min, long max) {
        // Base case: an empty node is valid
        if (node == null) return true;

        // If current node breaks the valid range rule
        if (node.val <= min || node.val >= max) return false;

        // Recursively check left and right subtrees
        return validate(node.left, min, node.val) &&
               validate(node.right, node.val, max);
    }
}
🧮 Time and Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) → We visit each node once.

Space Complexity: O(h) → h is the height of the tree (recursive call stack).

Great question, Rahul! Let’s break it down in a very simple way 👇

💡 What is Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE?
In Java:

long is a data type that stores very large integers.

Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE are constants provided by Java that represent the smallest and largest values a long can hold.

✅ Values:
Constant	Value
Long.MIN_VALUE	-9223372036854775808
Long.MAX_VALUE	9223372036854775807
So these are:

Long.MIN_VALUE = Smallest possible number a long can hold.

Long.MAX_VALUE = Largest possible number a long can hold.

🤔 Why are we using these in the BST validation?
We use these as the initial boundaries (range):

java
Copy code
validate(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);
This means:

The root node is allowed to have any value from the lowest possible to the highest possible.

Then, as we go left and right in the tree, we update this range to check if all values follow the BST rule.

🔍 Why not use Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE?
Because:

BST node values can be from -2³¹ to 2³¹ - 1 (as per the problem: -2^31 ≤ Node.val ≤ 2^31 - 1)

So if we use Integer.MIN_VALUE and a node has that value, it might cause overflow or wrong comparison.

Using long avoids that problem by giving a wider range.

✅ In short:
Long.MIN_VALUE → lowest number we can safely use (-9223372036854775808)

Long.MAX_VALUE → highest number we can safely use (9223372036854775807)

We use them to define a safe and wide range for BST checking.

Let me know if you'd like me to draw a diagram or dry run example using these ranges!

then what is the purpose to give constraint

🔥 Awesome question, Rahul! You're thinking like a real developer now — let's dive into why they give constraints in the question even when we use Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE in code.

❓ Question:
If the problem says:

diff
Copy code
-2³¹ <= Node.val <= 2³¹ - 1
Then why do we still use Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE in the code?

✅ Purpose of the Constraint in the Question
The constraint in the question tells you:

🔒 “The values in the tree will always be within this range.”
→ That means:
Node.val is always between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647
Which is the full range of an int in Java.

So basically, the input will never contain a value outside this range.

✅ Then Why Use long in Code?
Excellent question — here's why we use long in code:

🧠 Reason:
We need to compare values outside the node’s value.

Let’s say:

We have a node with value = Integer.MIN_VALUE = -2,147,483,648

Then we go to its left child
→ We check:

java
Copy code
if (node.val <= min) // min = Long.MIN_VALUE
But now if we pass Integer.MIN_VALUE as min, and the node also has value Integer.MIN_VALUE, the check:

java
Copy code
node.val <= min
will fail even though there is no smaller value possible.

➡️ That’s why we use long — it gives us extra room, so that the comparison logic is always safe and doesn’t break due to edge cases.
